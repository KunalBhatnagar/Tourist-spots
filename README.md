##  **Spot Locater**
Spot Locater is a dynamic web application built with React that allows users to search for any city and discover the top 10 tourist spots. The application features an interactive world map powered by Leaflet, which zooms into the searched location, providing a rich and engaging user experience. Users are presented with a visually appealing interface, including animated transitions, pop-up displays, and background images of the searched city, fetched directly from Unsplash.

## Features
-> Interactive World Map: An animated world map that zooms in on the searched city, providing a geographical context for the tourist spots.
-> Tourist Spot Discovery: Fetches and displays the top 10 tourist spots of a city, complete with descriptions and ratings, using the OpenTripMap API.
-> Dynamic UI Elements: A search bar that smoothly transitions to the top of the page after searching, and dual pop-up containers that showcase both the map and tourist spots side by side.
-> Background Imagery: City-specific background images are fetched from Unsplash, with a seamless blend into the map, enhancing the visual appeal of the application.
-> Responsive Design: Fully responsive design, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
-> React: For building the user interface and managing state.
-> Leaflet: For interactive map rendering and location zoom functionality.
-> OpenTripMap API: To retrieve city coordinates and top tourist spots.
-> Unsplash API: To fetch high-quality images of the searched city.
-> CSS: Custom styling for a modern, clean, and responsive design.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
